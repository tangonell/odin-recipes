        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Mochi is a bun-shaped Japanese dessert made from sweet glutinous rice flour, or mochigome.
            It has a soft, chewy texture that is somewhat elastic.
            Mochi is often flavored with matcha (or green tea powder), which gives it a light green hue.
        </p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup sweetened red bean paste</li>
            <li>1 cup glutinous rice flour</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon green tea powder (matcha)</li>
            <li>1 cup water</li>
            <li>1/4 cup white sugar</li>
            <li>1/2 cup cornstarch, for rolling out the dough</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Gather all ingredients.
            </li>
            <li>
                Wrap red bean paste in aluminum foil and place in the freezer until solid, at least 1 hour.
            </li>
            <li>
                Mix glutinous rice flour and green tea powder thoroughly in a microwave-safe bowl.
            </li>
            <li>
                Stir in water, then sugar; mix until smooth.
            </li>
            <li>
                Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and microwave for 3 minutes 30 seconds.
            </li>
            <li>
                Meanwhile, remove red bean paste from the freezer and divide into 8 equal balls. Set aside.
            </li>
            <li>
                Remove rice flour mixture from the microwave. Stir and heat, covered, for another 15 to 30 seconds.
            </li>
            <li>
                Dust a work surface with cornstarch.
                Roll about 2 tablespoons of hot rice flour mixture into a ball.
                Flatten the ball and place one ball of frozen red bean paste in the center.
                Pinch and press the dough around the bean paste until completely covered.
            </li>
            <li>
                Sprinkle with additional cornstarch and place mochi, seam-side down, in a paper muffin liner to prevent sticking.
            </li>
        </ol>
